[18/12/25 09:14:55.994] [Experiment 'P_2_1_Letter_Dimensions'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that computes and returns the dimensions of a letter-size (8.5 x 11 inches) sheet of paper in millimeters. There are 25.4 millimeters per inch. Use constants and comments in your method.

The signature should be:

method letter_dimensions() returns (width:real, height:real)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures width == 8.5 * 25.4, ensures height == 11.0 * 25.4

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
