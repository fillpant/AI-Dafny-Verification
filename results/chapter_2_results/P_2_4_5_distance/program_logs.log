[18/12/25 09:16:15.725] [Experiment 'P_2_4_5_distance'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes two integers and then returns the distance (absolute value of the difference).

The signature should be:

method distance(x: int, y: int) returns (result:int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures result >= 0, ensures if x >= y then result == x - y else result == y - x

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
