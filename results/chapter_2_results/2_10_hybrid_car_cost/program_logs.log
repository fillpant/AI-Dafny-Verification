[18/12/25 09:17:10.067] [Experiment '2_10_hybrid_car_cost'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your methods's inputs should be: the cost of a new car, the estimated miles driven per year, the estimated gas price, the efficiency in miles per gallon, the estimated resale value after 5 years. Compute the total cost of owning the car for five years.

The signature should be:

method hybrid_car_cost(new_car_cost: real, miles_per_year: real, gas_price: real, mpg: real, resale_value: real) returns (total_cost: real)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires 0.0 < mpg, ensures total_cost == new_car_cost + (miles_per_year / mpg) * gas_price * 5.0 - resale_value

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
