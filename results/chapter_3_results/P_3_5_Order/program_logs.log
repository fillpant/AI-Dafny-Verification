[18/12/25 09:19:46.651] [Experiment 'P_3_5_Order'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes three numbers and returns "increasing" if they are in increasing order, "decreasing" if they are in decreasing order, and "neither" otherwise. Here, "increasing" means "strictly increasing", with each value larger than its predecessor. The sequence 3 4 4 would not be considered increasing.

The signature should be:

method P_3_5_Order (i:int, j: int, k: int) returns (s: string)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures if i < j < k then s == "increasing" else if i > j && j > k then s == "decreasing" else s== "neither"

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
