[18/12/25 09:19:56.599] [Experiment 'P_3_7_Order'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes three integers and returns "in order" if they are sorted in ascending or descending order, or "not in order" otherwise.

The signature should be:

method P_3_7_Order (i:int, j: int, k: int) returns (s: string)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures if (i < j < k) || (i > j > k) then s == "in order" else s == "not in order"

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
