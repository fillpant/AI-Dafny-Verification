[18/12/25 09:12:39.361] [Experiment 'p_1_3'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns the product of the first ten positive integers, 1 * 2 * ... * 10.

The signature should be:

method p_1_3() returns (i : int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures i == factorial(10)

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function factorial(n : int) : int
  decreases n
{
  if n <= 1 then 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
