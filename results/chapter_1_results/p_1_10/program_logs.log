[18/12/25 09:13:13.764] [Experiment 'p_1_10'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns an animal speaking a greeting in ASCII art.

The signature should be:

method p_1_10() returns (s : string)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures s == "  /\\_/\\     /---\\\n ( ' ' )  / Hello \\\n (  -  )  |  New  |\n  | | |   \\ Coder /\n (__|__)    \\----/\n"

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
