[18/12/25 09:13:05.847] [Experiment 'p_1_8'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns an imitation of a Piet Mondrian painting. (Search the Internet if you are not familiar with his paintings.) Use character sequences such as @@@ or ::: to indicate different colors, and use - and | to form lines.

The signature should be:

method p_1_8() returns (s : string)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures s == mystring("          !!!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n", 5)

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function mystring(s : string, n : nat): string
{
  if n == 0 then "" else s + mystring(s, n - 1)
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
