[18/12/25 09:51:56.108] [Experiment 'p5_8_scramble'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that constructs a scrambled version of string, randomly flipping two characters other than the first and last ones.

The signature should be:

method p5_8_word_scramble(word: string) returns (scrambled: string)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires 1 <= |word|, ensures |word| == |scrambled|, ensures word[0] == scrambled[0], ensures word[|word| - 1] == scrambled[|scrambled| - 1], ensures |word| >= 4 ==>  exists i, j :: 1 <= i < j <= |word| - 2 && word[i] == scrambled[j] && word[j] == scrambled[i] && forall k:: 0 <= k <= |word| -1 ==> (k!=i && k!=j ==> word[k] == scrambled[k])

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
