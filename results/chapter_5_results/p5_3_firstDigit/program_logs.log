[18/12/25 09:47:41.987] [Experiment 'p5_3_firstDigit'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method returning the first digit of the argument.

The signature should be:

method p5_3_firstDigit(n: int) returns (first: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires 0 <= n, ensures 0 <= first < 10, ensures intToSeq(n)[0] == first

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function intToSeq(n: int) : seq<int>
  requires n >= 0
  ensures forall d :: d in intToSeq(n) ==> 0 <= d < 10
{
  if n < 10 then [n]
  else intToSeq(n / 10) + [n % 10]
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
