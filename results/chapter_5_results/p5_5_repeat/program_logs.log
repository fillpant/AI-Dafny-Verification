[18/12/25 09:48:31.146] [Experiment 'p5_5_repeat'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns a string repeated n times. For example, repeat("ho", 3) returns "hohoho".

The signature should be:

method p5_5_repeat(str: seq<char>, n: int) returns (repeatedStr: seq<char>)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires n >= 0, ensures |repeatedStr| == n * |str|, ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < n ==> repeatedStr[i * |str| .. (i + 1) * |str| - 1 ] == str

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
