[18/12/25 09:52:05.425] [Experiment 'p5_9_sphereSurface'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that computes the surface of a sphere given its radius.

The signature should be:

method p5_9_sphereSurface(r: real) returns (surface_area: real)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures surface_area == 4.0 * 3.14159 * r * r

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
