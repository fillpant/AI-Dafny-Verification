[18/12/25 09:47:48.744] [Experiment 'p5_4_middle'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns the middle character of a string if the length is odd, or the two middle characters if the length is even. For example, middle("middle") returns "dd".

The signature should be:

method p5_4_middle(str: seq<char>) returns (middleStr: seq<char>)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires 0 < |str|, ensures if |str| % 2 == 1 then |middleStr| == 1 else |middleStr| == 2, ensures if |str| % 2 == 1 then middleStr[0] == str[|str| / 2] else middleStr == str[|str| / 2 - 1 .. |str| / 2]

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
