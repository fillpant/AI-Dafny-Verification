[18/12/25 09:47:34.377] [Experiment 'p5_2_b_allDifferent'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method returning true if the arguments are all different.

The signature should be:

method p5_2_b_allDifferent(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (allDiff: bool)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures allDiff == (x != y && y != z && x != z)

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
