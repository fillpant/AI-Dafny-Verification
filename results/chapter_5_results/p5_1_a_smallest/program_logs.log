[18/12/25 09:47:22.408] [Experiment 'p5_1_a_smallest'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that returns the smallest of the arguments.

The signature should be:

method p5_1_a_smallest(x: real, y: real, z: real) returns (smallest: real)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures smallest <= x && smallest <= y && smallest <= z, ensures smallest == x || smallest == y || smallest == z

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
