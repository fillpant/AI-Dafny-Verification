[18/12/25 09:31:31.926] [Experiment 'p4_4_month_with_highest_temperature'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that reads a sequence of twelve temperature values and returns the number of the month with the highest temperature.

The signature should be:

method p4_5_month_with_highest_temperature(inputs: seq<real>) returns (hottest: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires |inputs| == 12, ensures 1 <= hottest <= 12, ensures forall i :: 0 <= i <= |inputs|-1 ==> inputs[hottest-1] >= inputs[i]

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
