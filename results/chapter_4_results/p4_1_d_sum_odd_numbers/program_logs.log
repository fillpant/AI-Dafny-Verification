[18/12/25 09:27:04.096] [Experiment 'p4_1_d_sum_odd_numbers'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method with loops that computes the sum of all odd numbers between a and b (inclusive), where a and b are inputs.

The signature should be:

method p4_1_d_sum_odd_numbers(a: int, b: int) returns (sum: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures sum == sum_odd(a, b)

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function sum_odd(a: int, b: int): int
decreases b - a
{
  if a > b then 0
  else if a % 2 == 1 then a + sum_odd(a + 1, b)
  else sum_odd(a + 1, b)
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
