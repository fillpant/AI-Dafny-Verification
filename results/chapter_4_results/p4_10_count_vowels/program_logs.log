[18/12/25 09:33:13.567] [Experiment 'p4_10_count_vowels'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that reads a word and returns the number of vowels in the word.

The signature should be:

method p4_10_count_vowels(s: string) returns (count: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures 0 <= count, ensures forall c :: c in s ==> c in ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'] ==> count >= 1, ensures (forall c :: c in s ==> c !in ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']) ==> count == 0

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
