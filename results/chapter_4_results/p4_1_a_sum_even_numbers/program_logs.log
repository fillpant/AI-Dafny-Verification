[18/12/25 09:26:31.802] [Experiment 'p4_1_a_sum_even_numbers'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method with loops that computes the sum of all even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive).

The signature should be:

method p4_1_a_sum_even_numbers() returns (sum: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures sum == 2550

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
