[18/12/25 09:31:36.192] [Experiment 'p4_5_analyze_floats'] [INFO]: Experiment started.
[18/12/25 09:31:36.193] [Experiment 'p4_5_analyze_floats'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes a sequence of floatingpoint numbers and returns: - the average of the values. - the smallest of the values. - the largest of the values. - the range, that is the difference between the smallest and largest.

The signature should be:

method p4_5_analyze_floats(values: seq<real>) returns (average: real, min: real, max: real, range: real)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires 0 < |values|, ensures average == (sum(values) / |values| as real), ensures forall v :: v in values ==> min <= v, ensures forall v :: v in values ==> max >= v, ensures range == max - min, ensures exists v :: v in values && min == v, ensures exists v :: v in values && max == v

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function sum(values: seq<real>): real
{
  if |values| == 0 then 0.0
  else values[0] + sum(values[1..])
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
