[18/12/25 09:27:53.740] [Experiment 'p4_2_b_count_even_odd'] [INFO]: Experiment started.
[18/12/25 09:27:53.740] [Experiment 'p4_2_b_count_even_odd'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes a sequence of integers and returns the number of even and odd inputs.

The signature should be:

method p4_2_b_count_even_odd(inputs: seq<int>) returns (even_count: int, odd_count: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures even_count == number_even(inputs[..]), ensures odd_count == number_odd(inputs[..])

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function number_odd(s:seq<int>): int
{ if s == [] then 0
  else if s[0] % 2 == 1 then 1 + number_odd(s[1..])
  else number_odd(s[1..])
}

function number_even (s:seq<int>): int
{ if s == [] then 0
  else if s[0] % 2 == 0 then 1 + number_even(s[1..])
  else number_even(s[1..])
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
