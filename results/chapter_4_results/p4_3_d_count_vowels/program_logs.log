[18/12/25 09:30:42.892] [Experiment 'p4_3_d_count_vowels'] [INFO]: Experiment started.
[18/12/25 09:30:42.892] [Experiment 'p4_3_d_count_vowels'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method that takes a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.

The signature should be:

method p4_3_d_count_vowels(s: string) returns (count: int)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures count >= 0, ensures forall c :: c in s && c in ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'] ==> count >= 1, ensures (forall c :: c in s ==> c !in ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']) ==> count == 0

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
