[18/12/25 09:26:49.776] [Experiment 'p4_1_c_powers_of_two'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method with loops that computes all powers of 2 from 2^0 up to 2^20.

The signature should be:

method p4_1_c_powers_of_two() returns (powers: seq<int>)

The method should respect the following contract:

ensures |powers| == 21, ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |powers| ==> powers[i] == pow(2, i)

The contract uses the following dafny code:

function pow(base: int, exp: int): int
  requires  0 <= exp
  decreases exp
{
  if exp == 0 then 1 else base * pow(base, exp - 1)
}

These function(s) must not be used in your implementation of the method.

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
