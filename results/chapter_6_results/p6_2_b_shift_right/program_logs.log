[18/12/25 10:00:20.688] [Experiment 'p6_2_b_shift_right'] [INFO]: Experiment started.
[18/12/25 10:00:20.688] [Experiment 'p6_2_b_shift_right'] [INFO]: Using initial prompt: You are given the following task to perform in Dafny:

Write a method to shift all elements of an array by one to the right and move the last element into the first position. For example, [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] would be transformed into [25, 1, 4, 9, 16].

The signature should be:

method p6_2_b_shift_right(arr: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)

The method should respect the following contract:

requires |arr| >= 1, ensures |result| == |arr|, ensures result[0] == arr[|arr| - 1], ensures forall i :: 1 <= i < |arr| ==> result[i] == arr[i - 1]

Produce and show only the Dafny body of this method, including the curly braces that surround it. Do not show the signature nor contract. You must not use 'assume' anywhere in your code.
